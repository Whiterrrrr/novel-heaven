Lary just wake up

Lary Potter groaned as sunlight streamed through the thin curtains of his cramped bedroom on Privet Drive. His head throbbed dully, a remnant of the strange dream that had haunted him all nightflashes of green light, a cold laugh echoing in the shadows, and a pair of glowing red eyes that seemed to pierce right through him. He rubbed his temples, trying to shake off the unease clinging to him like cobwebs. 

Downstairs, the clatter of Aunt Petunias frying pan signaled the start of another miserable day. Lary dragged himself out of bed, his bare feet hitting the cold floorboards. The Dursleys had never bothered to heat his room properly, not that they cared. He glanced at the broken alarm clock on his nightstandanother handmedown from Dudley, of courseand sighed. 

As he pulled on his oversized shirt (another castoff from his cousin), a faint rustling noise made him freeze. Something moved beneath his bed. Lary crouched down, heart pounding, and yanked up the dusty edge of the bedsheet. A pair of tiny, glowing eyes blinked back at him. 

Youve got to be kidding me, he muttered. 

The creatureno bigger than a rat, with shimmering silver fur and delicate wingslet out a highpitched chirp before darting out from under the bed and zipping around the room like a frantic firefly. Lary scrambled after it, knocking over a stack of old textbooks in the process. The creature perched on the windowsill, tilting its head as if studying him. 

What are you? Lary whispered. 

Before he could get an answer, Uncle Vernons bellow echoed up the stairs. BOY! Get down here now or no breakfast! 

The creature let out a startled squeak and vanished in a puff of silver mist. Lary stared at the empty spot, wondering if hed finally lost his mind. Shaking his head, he hurried downstairs, where the Dursleys were already seated at the table, digging into heaping plates of eggs and bacon. Aunt Petunia sniffed as he slipped into his usual seat. 

Sleeping in again, I see, she said disdainfully. Lazy boy. 

Lary ignored her, his mind still racing. That creature hadnt been a dreamhe was sure of it. And if it was real, then maybe the other strange things hed noticed lately were too the way his reflection sometimes moved on its own, the whispers in the walls at night, the way Dudleys toys inexplicably broke whenever his cousin tried to hit him with them. 

As he nibbled on a piece of dry toast, a determined thought settled in his mind. He needed answers. And if the Dursleys wouldnt give them to him (which they never would), hed have to find them himself. 

That night, after the house fell silent, Lary crept out of bed and tiptoed to the loose floorboard near his desk. Inside, hidden beneath a layer of dust and old socks, was a small, leatherbound book with no title. Hed found it years ago but had never dared to open ituntil now. 

The moment his fingers brushed the cover, a faint hum vibrated through the air. Lary took a deep breath and flipped it open. 

The first page bore a single line, written in shimmering ink that seemed to shift colors as he stared 

The truth is closer than you think, Lary Potter. 

His pulse quickened. Whatever was happening to him, whatever that creature was, one thing was certainhis life was about to change.
